# ChemoSpec 5.0.229 2019-02-28
## Misc.
* Unit tests added for `.cleanArgs`.

# ChemoSpec 5.0.215 2018-12-06
## Improvements
* `files2SpectraObject` can now accept *any* arguments to `list.files` or `read.table` via the ... mechanism.  Arguments are sanitized more robustly.  However, it is possible to pass arguments that may not be of real utility.  For instance `na.strings` can be specified, but any `NA` in the data imported will trigger warnings and errors.

## Misc.
* `plotScree` added to `r_pcaSpectra` example.

# ChemoSpec 5.0.207 2018-11-28

## Improvements
* `files2SpectraObject` can now accept optional arguments `path` and `recursive` to allow reading through a directory substructure.  In addition, a progress bar is now displayed unless `debug = TRUE`. Both features suggested by Reinhard Kerschner along with preliminary code (thanks!).

# ChemoSpec 5.0.193 2018-11-20

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed a problem with color assignment in `.groupNcolor` (the problem seems to have been present from the very beginning).  Reported by Reinhard Kerschner (many thanks!). Note `.groupNcolor` now resides in `ChemoSpecUtils`.  Reported here for convenience.

## Improvements
* `matrix2SpectraObject` now uses `tryCatch()` to more gracefully fail and offer suggestions to user.
* `files2SpectraObject`
