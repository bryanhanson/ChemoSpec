\title{Spectra Objects}
\description{
In \code{ChemoSpec}, spectral data sets are stored in an S3 class called
\code{Spectra}, which contains a variety of information in addition to the
spectra themselves.  \code{Spectra} objects are created by
\code{\link{files2SpectraObject}} or \code{\link{matrix2SpectraObject}}.
}
\section{Structure}{
 The structure of a \code{Spectra} object is a list of 9
elements and an attribute as follows:
\itemize{
\item \emph{element} (\emph{type}) \emph{description}
\item \strong{$freq} (numeric) A common frequency (or wavelength) axis for all the spectra.
\item \strong{$data} (numeric) The intensities for the spectra.  A matrix of dimension no. samples x no. frequency points.
\item \strong{$names} (character) The sample names for the spectra; length must be no. samples.
\item \strong{$groups} (factor) The group classification of the samples; length must be no. samples.
\item \strong{$colors} (character) The colors for each sample; length must be no. samples. Groups and colors correspond.
\item \strong{$sym} (integer) As for \code{colors}, but symbols for plotting (if b/w is desired).
\item \strong{$alt.sym} (character) Lower-case letters as alternate symbols for plotting.
\item \strong{$unit} (character) Two entries, the first giving the x axis unit, the second the y axis unit.
\item \strong{$desc} (character) A character string describing the data set.  This appears on plots and therefore should probably be kept to 40 characters or less.
\item 
\itemize{
\item attr character with value "Spectra" The S3 class designation.
