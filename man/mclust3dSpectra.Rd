\title{mclust Analysis of a Spectra Object in 3D}
\usage{
mclust3dSpectra(
  spectra,
  pca,
  pcs = c(1:3),
  ellipse = TRUE,
  rob = FALSE,
  cl = 0.95,
  frac.pts.used = 0.8,
  truth = NULL,
  title = "no title provided",
  t.pos = NULL,
  lab.opts = FALSE,
  use.sym = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{An object of S3 class \code{\link{Spectra}}.}

\item{pca}{An object of class \code{\link{prcomp}}.}

\item{pcs}{An integer vector describing which PCs to use.}

\item{ellipse}{Logical indicating if confidence ellipses should be drawn.}

\item{rob}{Logical; if \code{ellipse = TRUE}, indicates that robust
confidence ellipses should be drawn.  If \code{FALSE}, classical confidence
ellipses are drawn.}

\item{cl}{A number indicating the confidence interval for the ellipse.}

\item{frac.pts.used}{If \code{ellipse = TRUE} and \code{rob = TRUE}, a
number indicating the fraction of the data points to be considered "good"
and thus used to compute the robust confidence ellipse.}

\item{truth}{A character vector indicating the known group membership for
reach row of the PC scores.  Generally this would be \code{spectra$groups}.
#' @param title A character string for the plot title.}

\item{title}{A character string giving the title.}

\item{t.pos}{A character selection from \code{LETTERS[1:8]} ( = A through H)
indicating the desired location for the title.}

\item{lab.opts}{A logical indicating whether or not to display the locations
where the title and legend can be placed.  These locations are the corners
of a cube surrounding the data.}

\item{use.sym}{Logical; if true, the color scheme is changed to black and
symbols are used for plotting.}

\item{\dots}{Other parameters to be passed downstream.}
}
\value{
The mclust model is returned invisibly, and a plot is produced.
}
\description{
This function conducts an mclust analysis of the PCA results of a
\code{\link{Spectra}} object and displays the results in 3D.  Classical or
robust confidence ellipses can be added if desired. Improperly classified
data points can be marked.  rgl graphics are employed.
}
\details{
If you intend to make a hard copy of your plot, use \code{lab.opts = TRUE}
until you have found a good view of your data.  Then note corners of the
cube where the title won't interfere with viewing the data, and use this for
\code{t.pos}, and add \code{title}.  Adjust as necessary, then turn off
label display using \code{lab.opts = FALSE}.  Back at the console, use
\code{> rgl.snapshot("file_name.png")} to create the hardcopy.

Note that the confidence ellipses computed here are generated independently
of the \code{Mclust} results - they do not correspond to the ellipses seen
in 2D plots from \code{Mclust}.
